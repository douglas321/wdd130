    <h2>Carter Sperry</h2>
    <p>Hi y'all! My name is Carter Sperry and I'm in my sophmore year here at BYU-I. I'm currently majoring but we'll see what happens.</p>
    <p>For fun I love to be outdoors. This past summer I spent a week in the sawtooths hiking to some of the more popular lakes and it was a blast. Aside from hiking, I enjoy playing sports like basketball and badminton. When the weathers worse or im feeling especially lzy im also a fan of plopping on the couch and watching a good movie or playing a video game. Currently me and my roomates are watching all the Disney Animation Studio films from newset to oldest.</p>
